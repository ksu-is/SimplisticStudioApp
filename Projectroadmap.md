### Codebase Exploration
**Repository Reviewed:** [Fashion-Design-App](https://github.com/smriti05/fashion-design-app)

**Summary:**  
This open-source project provides a digital fashion design prototype built using Flask and HTML/CSS. It inspired the Simplistic Studio App’s concept of enabling online design previews.  
I reviewed its structure, ran the app locally after installing dependencies, and noted that it can serve as a useful reference for handling image uploads and templates.

**Planned Improvements:**  
- Add analytics dashboard for product performance  
- Integrate inventory and marketing automation tools  
- Modernize the front-end with React components
